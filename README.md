# 🚀 PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my projects, blog posts, and provides an easy way to contact me.

## 📌 About the Project

This portfolio contains several key sections:

- 🏠 **Home** – A welcome message, short bio, and the ability to download my resume.
- 📝 **Recent Posts** – A blog section featuring the latest articles on design and Figma.
- 🎮 **Projects** – Features an interactive carousel with multiple projects, such as a game portal, a video service, and other creative works.
- 📂 **Blog** – Uses an accordion effect for easy reading of posts.
- 📞 **Contacts** – Provides location, Telegram/WhatsApp contact, email, and a feedback form.

> **Note:** This portfolio was created without a full-fledged design mockup. Instead, I combined elements from different website mockups to craft a unique and functional layout.
